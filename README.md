# Car-Rental_DBMS
Java program to mimic a car rental system. Allows users to select, edit, or insert the default 10 tables into the DBMS. If the user wants to modify a specific table then they can first select a table and then right-click a record to delete it or right-click anywhere on the table to add a new record.

Oracle was DBMS used for this but any relational DB such as DB2 should work but there may or may not be some differences in the SQL syntax when callign certain queries
